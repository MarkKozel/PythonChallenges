# Python DataTypes

## Objectives
Use the python's standard datatypes

## Instructions
1. Define 2 ```int``` variables. Add them together into a 3rd variable
    - Print all 3 variables
1. Define 2 ```float``` variables. Multiply them together into a 3rd variable
    - Print all 3 variables
1. Define 2 string variable
    - Print them using concatenation
1. Define an array of 5 ```int``` values
    - Print the whole array
    - Print the 3rd value

> Gotchas/Hints
>> To print strings and variables on the same line, pass each part in to the ```print()``` command
>> ``` python
>>     MyVar1 = 12
>>     MyVar2 = 42
>>     print("MyVar1 = ", MyVar, ". MyVal2 = ", MyVar2)
>> ```
>> Output should be
>> ```bash
>>     MyVal1 = 12. MyVar2 = 42
>> ```
>
>> Python uses zero-based array indexing like most modern-day languages
