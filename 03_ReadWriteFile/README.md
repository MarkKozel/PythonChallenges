> Gotchas/Hints
>> Python doesn't use curly brackets ```{}```. It uses indention to indicate related blocks of code, like a loop
>>
>> When working with files it is important to close them as soon as the code no longer needs to read/write data to them
>>
>> Python has different file operations for reading individual character(bytes) and reading a whole line (terminated by ```\n```, ```\r```, or ```\r\n```)
